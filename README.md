The mechanisms listed here show an automatically generated _n_-Pentane mechanism. The model was tested across a range of temperatures (650 to 1350K) and equivalence ratios (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) at pressures of 1 and 10 atm. Available thermodynamic and kinetic databases were incorporated and tested for their ability to generate consistent kinetic models. Some rate parameters have been modified that are available in our paper entitled as "Automated Generation of a Compact Chemical Kinetic Model for _n_-Pentane Combustion". The resulting models show reasonable performance in comparison with published experimental data and predictions of the most established prior models for ignition delay times and flame speed calculations of _n_-Pentane which can be extended to construct reliable models for combustion of larger _n_-alkanes.
